# v1.5.1

* Each spell costs a minimum of 5 mp, and it's easier to reduce the mp cost than before.

* You can only have a maximum of 5 summons total between all spells.

* Spirit shield
    * Since players have much more magic now, to keep spirit shield from being too powerful, it behaves as if you
      have half as much max mp. So if you have 50 max hp, and 100 max mp, half of your damage would come from hp,
      and half would come from mp (since it acts as if you had 50 mp).

* Unlimited ammo
    * If you fire a ranged weapon without ammo, the unbranded ammo fires.
    * Unbranded ammo no longer spawns.
    * Branded ammo still spawn in higher quantities than before, but always mulches.
    * You can switch to unbranded ammo by hitting the quiver command 'Q', and then '-', just like weilding nothing.

* One shot kill protection
    * Player isn't allowed to receive more than some percentage of damage between times when the player can act.
        * This means, even if paralyzed, there is a limit to how much damage can be done before the player gets
          a chance to do something about it.
    * Nightmare mode: 75% damage per turn max
    * Challenge mode: 50% damage per turn max
    * Standard mode:  25% damage per turn max
    * What this means, for example, is that in standard mode, a player can't die in 3 turns (assuming they began
      at full health).

* Labyrinth allows auto-explore
    * It's not super reliable, but I find that is removes some tedium without making it totally trivial.

* Increased Fighting and/or Spellcasting skills for all starting jobs that use them by 1, to make it a little
  easier for characters to get off the ground with the recent changes.

* Orc branch has been doubled in size, to 8 floors
    * The "boss" level is still on floor 4.
    * Floors 5-8 don't give experience for kills, although they will restore drain and charge evocables.

* Turned off monster spawning.
    * Increased initial floor population by 20% to compensate.
    * Monsters still spawn in Abyss and during orb run.

* Deactivated ghosts.
    * I have a better solution, but for now this will help.

* Magic potions restore 40, 30, 20 points depending on difficulty mode.
* Stamina potions restore 40, 30, 20 points depending on difficulty mode.

* Spell factors:
    * Spell failure: dexterity, spellcasting, spell schools
    * Spell power: intelligence, spell schools
    * Spell cost: intelligence, spellcasting

* Removed all food, and created stamina potions. You can now sacrifice stamina potions to evoke fedhas' abilities.
* Quick mode doesn't use stamina if monsters aren't around.

## v1.5

* Stamina overhaul
    * Extremely brief summary: you won't be able to swing around a broad axe as a spriggan with 5 str just as well as
      an ogre with 25 str any more. Trying to swing that broad axe as a spriggan will exhaust the player almost immediately,
      whereas and ogre with some minimal fighting skill (say 3) can use it quite a few times before getting tired. But
      even for an ogre, throwing a large rock is going to be expensive stamina-wise.
    * Normal mode fighting actions cost stamina points (SP).
    * SP cost of attack is based on fighting skill, strength, weapon weight.
        * Heavier weapons will cost more stamina to swing than lighter ones.
    * Spells only cost magic points (MP), no more spell hunger.
    * MP cost is based on spellcasting, intelligence, spell level.
    * You can see how much spells cost in the 'S' spell list.
    * Fixed size MP pool like SP pool. Does not go up with experience level (XL).
    * Power mode adds an SP cost to affected actions.
        * In addition to increasing damage by 33%, power mode now increases attack speed by the same.
    * Careful mode renamed to focus mode.
    * Focus mode adds an MP cost to affected actions.
    * Escape mode was removed and in it's place a separate quick / normal mode
        * This can operate independently of exertion mode, i.e. you can have Quick mode + Focus or Quick + Power mode.
        * Quick mode has the benefits of the old escape mode, which are faster movement speed. But
          there is also an additional stamina cost. Stealth is also dramatically reduced.
        * Normal mode doesn't have those benefits, but it doesn't have the additional stamina cost.
        * Quick mode no longer gives an evasion boost, only a speed boost.
        * Quick mode no longer has a stealth penalty.
        * Quick mode no longer has a movement penalty when changing directions.
    * If you run out of stamina in power mode, and it switches you back to normal mode, once you've recovered 50% of your
      SP, the game will automatically switch you back to power mode. Same applies to Focus mode.
    * Switching exertion modes (normal, power, focus), costs 1 turn.
    * Switching speed mode from normal to quick, costs 0 turns.
    * Switching speed mode from quick to normal, costs 1 turn.

* Summary of exertion modes: (existing info merged with changes from this update)
    * Normal mode
        * Melee and ranged attacks require SP based on weapon weight, player strength, and fighting skill.
            * Weapon skill does not affect SP cost.
        * Spell casting costs MP based on spell level, player intelligence, and spellcasting skill.
            * Spell school skills do not affect MP cost.
        * Damage, accuracy, stealth, spellpower, spell success, and attack speed are reduced from vanilla
          crawl levels, based on difficulty mode being played.
    * Power mode (same as normal mode except for the following)
        * +33% damage
        * +33% spellpower increase
        * +15% attack speed
        * -3 SP per attack or spell cast
    * Focus mode (same as normal mode except for the following)
        * +33% attack accuracy
        * +33% stealth
        * -15% spell failure chance or 1/2 failure chance, whichever is worse
        * -3 MP per movement or attack or spell cast

* Summary of Quick mode: (this can be on or off independently of the player's exertion mode)
    * Slow mode (normal state)
        * Movement delay is 1.1 for all species + slowing down effects, mutations, etc.
            * So a naga still is 1.3 speed because of the slow mutation they possess
    * Quick mode
        * Does NOT cost a turn to activate, but DOES cost a turn to deactivate.
        * Movement delay is based on species, artifact properties, mutations, spells in effect (haste, swiftness)
            * Standard species movement delay in quick mode is 0.9
        * -3 SP per movement
        * SP does not regenerate

* Keyboard changes
    * instead of 's' to open spell list, now you press 'S'
    * 'g' will switch to quick speed mode (go)
    * 's' will switch to normal speed mode (slow)
    * other stamina keys that are the same as the previous version:
        * 'e' turns on power mode. (exert)
        * 'c' changes back to normal mode. (cancel)
        * 'E' turns on focus mode. (E...xamine?)

* Spell failure
    * Spell failure is reduced by intelligence AND dexterity, as well as spellcasting and spell schools.
    * Significant simplification of failure calculations.
    * All spells are between 1 and 99% failure.
    * It's easier to get a level 9 spell down to 80% failure rate than in vanilla.
    * It's harder to get a level 9 spell down to 20% failure rate than in vanilla.
    * If all spell factors are at 10, a player has a 50% spell failure rate for a level 5 spell.
        * So if you've got 0 or 1 in 2 different factors, you can expect to have a hard time even casting level 1 spells.
