# v1.5.1

* Labyrinth allows auto-explore
    * It's not super reliable, but I find that is removes some tedium without making it totally trivial.
* Increased Fighting and/or Spellcasting skills for all starting jobs that use them by 1, to make it a little
  easier for characters to get off the ground with the recent changes.
* Orc branch has been doubled in size, to 8 floors
    * The "boss" level is still on floor 4.
    * Floors 5-8 don't give experience for kills, although they will restore drain and charge evocables.
* Turned off monster spawning.
    * Increased initial floor population by 20% to compensate.
    * Monsters still spawn in Abyss and during orb run.
* Deactivated ghosts.
    * I have a better solution, but for now this will help.
* Magic potions restore 40, 30, 20 points depending on difficulty mode.
* Stamina potions restore 40, 30, 20 points depending on difficulty mode.
* Spellcasting skill no longer influences spell power. It is only used for spell slots, reducing spell
  hunger, and reducing spell failure rate.
* Spell cost is not influenced by spell skills, only by spellcasting, intelligence, and spell level.
* Removed all food, and created stamina potions. You can now sacrifice stamina potions to evoke fedhas' abilities.
* Quick mode doesn't use stamina if monsters aren't around.

## v1.5

* Stamina overhaul
    * Extremely brief summary: you won't be able to swing around a broad axe as a spriggan with 5 str just as well as
      an ogre with 25 str any more. Trying to swing that broad axe as a spriggan will exhaust the player almost immediately,
      whereas and ogre with some minimal fighting skill (say 3) can use it quite a few times before getting tired. But
      even for an ogre, throwing a large rock is going to be expensive stamina-wise.
    * Normal mode fighting actions cost stamina points (SP).
    * SP cost of attack is based on fighting skill, strength, weapon weight.
        * Heavier weapons will cost more stamina to swing than lighter ones.
    * Spells only cost magic points (MP), no more spell hunger.
    * MP cost is based on spellcasting, intelligence, spell level.
    * You can see how much spells cost in the 'S' spell list.
    * Fixed size MP pool like SP pool. Does not go up with experience level (XL).
    * Power mode adds an SP cost to affected actions.
        * In addition to increasing damage by 33%, power mode now increases attack speed by the same.
    * Careful mode renamed to focus mode.
    * Focus mode adds an MP cost to affected actions.
        * In addition to improving stealth and accuracy by 33%, focus mode now improves evasion by the same.
    * Escape mode was removed and in it's place a separate quick / normal mode
        * This can operate independently of exertion mode, i.e. you can have Quick mode + Focus or Quick + Power mode.
        * Quick mode has the benefits of the old escape mode, which are faster movement speed. But
          there is also an additional stamina cost. Stealth is also dramatically reduced.
        * Normal mode doesn't have those benefits, but it doesn't have the additional stamina cost.
        * Quick mode no longer gives an evasion boost, only a speed boost.
        * Quick mode no longer has a stealth penalty.
        * Quick mode no longer has a movement penalty when changing directions.
    * If you run out of stamina in power mode, and it switches you back to normal mode, once you've recovered 50% of your
      SP, the game will automatically switch you back to power mode. Same applies to Focus mode.
    * Switching exertion modes (normal, power, focus), costs 1 turn.
    * Switching speed mode from normal to quick, costs 0 turns.
    * Switching speed mode from quick to normal, costs 1 turn.

* Summary of exertion modes: (existing info merged with changes from this update)
    * Normal mode
        * Melee and ranged attacks require SP based on weapon weight, player strength, and fighting skill.
            * Weapon skill does not affect SP cost.
        * Spell casting costs MP based on spell level, player intelligence, and spellcasting skill.
            * Spell school skills do not affect MP cost.
        * Damage, evasion, accuracy, stealth, spellpower, spell success, and attack speed are reduced from vanilla
          crawl levels, based on difficulty mode being played.
    * Power mode (same as normal mode except for the following)
        * +33% damage
        * +33% spellpower increase
        * +15% attack speed
        * -3 SP per attack or spell cast
    * Focus mode (same as normal mode except for the following)
        * +33% attack accuracy
        * +33% stealth
        * +33% evasion
        * -15% spell failure chance or 1/2 failure chance, whichever is worse
        * -3 MP per movement or attack or spell cast

* Summary of Quick mode: (this can be on or off independently of the player's exertion mode)
    * Slow mode (normal state)
        * Movement delay is 1.1 for all species + slowing down effects, mutations, etc.
            * So a naga still is 1.3 speed because of the slow mutation they possess
    * Quick mode
        * Does NOT cost a turn to activate, but DOES cost a turn to deactivate.
        * Movement delay is based on species, artifact properties, mutations, spells in effect (haste, swiftness)
            * Standard species movement delay in quick mode is 0.9
        * -3 SP per movement
        * SP does not regenerate

* Keyboard changes
    * instead of 's' to open spell list, now you press 'S'
    * 'g' will switch to quick speed mode (go)
    * 's' will switch to normal speed mode (slow)
    * other stamina keys that are the same as the previous version:
        * 'e' turns on power mode. (exert)
        * 'c' changes back to normal mode. (cancel)
        * 'E' turns on focus mode. (E...xamine?)

* Spell failure
    * Spell failure is reduced by intelligence AND dexterity, as well as spellcasting and spell schools.
    * Significant simplification of failure calculations.
    * All spells are between 1 and 99% failure.
    * It's easier to get a level 9 spell down to 80% failure rate than in vanilla.
    * It's harder to get a level 9 spell down to 20% failure rate than in vanilla.
    * If all spell factors are at 10, a player has a 50% spell failure rate for a level 5 spell.
        * So if you've got 0 or 1 in 2 different factors, you can expect to have a hard time even casting level 1 spells.
