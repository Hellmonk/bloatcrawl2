## v1.5

* Stamina overhaul
    * Normal mode fighting actions cost sp, power mode increases cost.
    * SP cost of attack based on fighting skill, strength, weapon weight.
        * Heavier weapons will cost more stamina to swing than lighter ones.
    * When a player runs out of SP, they can still attack, but at 75% damage, 75% accuracy, and 75% attack speed.
    * Spells only cost mp, no more spell hunger.
    * MP cost is based on spellcasting, intelligence, spell level.
    * You can see how much spells cost in the 'S' spell list.
    * Fixed size mp pool like sp pool. Does not go up with xl.
    * Power mode adds an SP cost to affected actions.
        * In addition to increasing damage by 33%, power mode now increases attack speed by the same.
    * Careful mode renamed to focus mode.
    * Focus mode adds an MP cost to affected actions.
        * In addition to improving stealth and accuracy by 33%, focus mode now improves evasion by the same.
    * Escape mode was removed and in it's place a separate quick / normal mode
        * This can operate independently of exertion mode, i.e. you can have Quick mode + Careful mode.
        * Quick mode has the benefits of the old escape mode, which are faster movement speed and increased evasion. But
          there is also an additional stamina cost. Stealth is also dramatically reduced.
        * Normal mode doesn't have those benefits, but it doesn't have the additional stamina cost.
        * Quick mode no longer gives an evasion boost, only a speed boost.
        * Quick mode drastically cuts stealth to 1/4 of normal mode stealth.
    * If you run out of stamina in power mode, and it switches you back to normal mode, once you've recovered 50% of your
      sp, the game will automatically switch you back to power mode.
    * Switching exertion modes (normal, power, focus), costs 1 turn.
    * Switching speed mode from normal to quick, costs 0 turns.
    * Switching speed mode from quick to normal, costs 1 turn.

* Keyboard changes
    * instead of 's' to open spell list, now you press 'S'
    * 'g' will switch to quick speed mode (go)
    * 's' will switch to normal speed mode (slow)
    * other stamina keys that are the same as the previous version:
        * 'e' turns on power mode. (exert)
        * 'c' changes back to normal mode. (cancel)
        * 'E' turns on focus mode. (E...xamine?)

* Spell failure
    * Spell failure is reduced by intelligence * dexterity / 5
        * Used to be intelligency * 2
    * Significant simplification of failure calculations.
    * All spells are between 0 and 100% failure. Even hard spells are just slightly below 100% failure.
    * It's easier to get a level 9 spell down to 80% failure rate than in vanilla.
    * It's harder to get a level 9 spell down to 20% failure rate than in vanilla.

* New branch layout
    * Dungeon contains: Orc (no rune), Lair of Beasts, Enchanted Forest, and Depths.
        * Orc has 4 floors, and contains an arena to battle in.
    * Enchanted Forest appears a little after Lair in the dungeon, and has 7 floors
    * Lair has 7 floors and contains four rune branches: Swamp, Shoals, Spider, and Snake (every game), each
      containing 4 floors.
    * Enchanted Forest has 7 floors and contains four rune branches: Crypt, Slime, Elven Halls, and Dwarven Fortress,
      each with 4 floors and a rune.
    * Depths contains: Vaults, Zot, Ziggurat, Abyss, Vestibule, and Pandemonium. All have 4 floors except vestibule
      and pan.
