## v1.5

* Stamina overhaul
    * Normal mode fighting actions cost sp, power mode increases cost.
    * SP cost of attack based on fighting skill, strength, weapon weight.
    * Spells only cost mp, no more spell hunger.
    * MP cost is based on spellcasting, intelligence, spell level.
    * Fixed size mp pool like sp pool.
    * Power mode adds an SP cost to affected actions.
    * Careful mode renamed to focus mode.
    * Focus mode adds an MP cost to affected actions.
    * Escape mode was removed and in it's place a separate quick / normal mode
        * This can operate independently of exertion mode, i.e. you can have Quick mode + Careful mode.
        * Quick mode has the benefits of the old escape mode, which are faster movement speed and increased evasion. But
          there is also an additional stamina cost. Stealth is also dramatically reduced.
        * Normal mode doesn't have those benefits, but it doesn't have the additional stamina cost.

    * 'g' will switch to quick mode (go)
    * 's' will switch to normal speed mode (slow)
