## v1.5

* Stamina overhaul
    * Normal mode fighting actions cost sp, power mode increases cost.
    * SP cost of attack based on fighting skill, strength, weapon weight.
        * Heavier weapons will cost more stamina to swing than lighter ones.
    * When a fighter runs out of SP, they can still attack, but at 75% damage and 75% accuracy.
    * Spells only cost mp, no more spell hunger.
    * MP cost is based on spellcasting, intelligence, spell level.
    * Fixed size mp pool like sp pool.
    * Power mode adds an SP cost to affected actions.
    * Careful mode renamed to focus mode.
    * Focus mode adds an MP cost to affected actions.
    * Escape mode was removed and in it's place a separate quick / normal mode
        * This can operate independently of exertion mode, i.e. you can have Quick mode + Careful mode.
        * Quick mode has the benefits of the old escape mode, which are faster movement speed and increased evasion. But
          there is also an additional stamina cost. Stealth is also dramatically reduced.
        * Normal mode doesn't have those benefits, but it doesn't have the additional stamina cost.
    * If you run out of stamina in power mode, and it switches you back to normal mode, once you've recovered 50% of your
      sp, the game will switch you back to power mode automatically.
    * Switching exertion modes (normal, power, focus), costs 1 turn.
    * Switching speed mode from normal to quick, costs 0 turns.
    * Switching speed mode from quick to normal, costs 1 turn.

* Keyboard changes
    * instead of 's' to open spell list, now you press 'S'
    * 'g' will switch to quick mode (go)
    * 's' will switch to normal speed mode (slow)

* Spell failure
    * Spell failure is reduced by intelligence * dexterity / 5
        * Used to be intelligency * 2
