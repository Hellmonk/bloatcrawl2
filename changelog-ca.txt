## v1.5.1

* Magic potions restore 40, 30, 20 points depending on difficulty mode.
* Spellcasting skill no longer influences spell power. It is only used for spell slots, reducing spell
  hunger, and reducing spell failure rate.
* Spell cost is not influenced by spell skills, only by spellcasting, intelligence, and spell level.
* Removed all food, and created stamina potions. You can now sacrifice stamina potions to evoke fedhas' abilities.
* Quick mode doesn't use stamina if monsters aren't around.

## v1.5

* Stamina overhaul
    * Normal mode fighting actions cost stamina points (SP).
    * SP cost of attack is based on fighting skill, strength, weapon weight.
        * Heavier weapons will cost more stamina to swing than lighter ones.
    * When a player runs out of SP, they can continue to attack, but at 75% damage, 75% accuracy, and 75% attack speed.
    * Spells only cost magic points (MP), no more spell hunger.
    * MP cost is based on spellcasting, intelligence, spell level.
    * You can see how much spells cost in the 'S' spell list.
    * Fixed size MP pool like SP pool. Does not go up with experience level (XL).
    * Power mode adds an SP cost to affected actions.
        * In addition to increasing damage by 33%, power mode now increases attack speed by the same.
    * Careful mode renamed to focus mode.
    * Focus mode adds an MP cost to affected actions.
        * In addition to improving stealth and accuracy by 33%, focus mode now improves evasion by the same.
    * Escape mode was removed and in it's place a separate quick / normal mode
        * This can operate independently of exertion mode, i.e. you can have Quick mode + Focus or Quick + Power mode.
        * Quick mode has the benefits of the old escape mode, which are faster movement speed. But
          there is also an additional stamina cost. Stealth is also dramatically reduced.
        * Normal mode doesn't have those benefits, but it doesn't have the additional stamina cost.
        * Quick mode no longer gives an evasion boost, only a speed boost.
        * Quick mode no longer has a stealth penalty.
        * Quick mode no longer has a movement penalty when changing directions.
    * If you run out of stamina in power mode, and it switches you back to normal mode, once you've recovered 50% of your
      SP, the game will automatically switch you back to power mode. Same applies to Focus mode.
    * Switching exertion modes (normal, power, focus), costs 1 turn.
    * Switching speed mode from normal to quick, costs 0 turns.
    * Switching speed mode from quick to normal, costs 1 turn.

* Summary of exertion modes: (existing info merged with changes from this update)

            * Spell school skills do not affect MP cost.

* Summary of Quick mode: (this can be on or off independently of the player's exertion mode)
    * Slow mode (normal state)
        * Movement delay is 1.1 for all species + slowing down effects, mutations, etc.
            * So a naga still is 1.3 speed because of the slow mutation they possess
    * Quick mode
        * Does NOT cost a turn to activate, but DOES cost a turn to deactivate.
        * Movement delay is based on species, artifact properties, mutations, spells in effect (haste, swiftness)

        * -3 SP per movement
        * SP does not regenerate

    * 'g' will switch to quick speed mode (go)
    * 's' will switch to normal speed mode (slow)
    * other stamina keys that are the same as the previous version:
        * 'e' turns on power mode. (exert)
        * 'c' changes back to normal mode. (cancel)
        * 'E' turns on focus mode. (E...xamine?)

* Spell failure
    * Spell failure is reduced by intelligence AND dexterity, as well as spellcasting and spell schools.
    * Significant simplification of failure calculations.
    * All spells are between 1 and 99% failure.
    * It's easier to get a level 9 spell down to 80% failure rate than in vanilla.
    * It's harder to get a level 9 spell down to 20% failure rate than in vanilla.
