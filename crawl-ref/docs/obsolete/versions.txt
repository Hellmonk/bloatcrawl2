     * Several spells added, mostly to make Earth, Ice, and Air magic
       viable in comparison to Fire;
     * Numerous rebalancings;

     * New races: Demonspawn, Ghoul and Kenku;
     * A new God, Yredemnul, and this one is a lot better than Nemelex,
       who has also been upgraded a bit) -- another option for Priests
       and Death Knights;
     * Changes to a few spells, and I finally got around to upgrading the
       crappy armour spells;

3.01 [~01.01.1999]

     * Bugfix release: Version 3.0 was a little bug-ridden, including a
       small problem where stats were raised by wearing almost anything.

       features;
     * A new dungeon branch;
     * A new God to worship; and
     * Sam Jansen has reformatted several modules (including the horrible
       dungeon.cc), making them far easier to read and work with.



2.95 [15.12.1998]

     * Fixed the bug in 2.94, by which reloading a level with a mapped
       arch on it crashed the game, has been fixed by saving all files in
       binary, rather than text, format;

       Error bug);
     * Several interface improvements;
     * Several rebalancings; and

       faster.

     * Many bugs fixed, and a few new features (mostly user interface).

     * Juho Snellman's macro-patch was added;
     * Random "artefact" weapons added -- these are special weapons with
       a wide range of possible abilities;

     * Hell and the Realm of Zot are now much nastier.

     * Adds some new user-interface features.



2.81 [20.10.1998]

     * Bugfix release.



2.80 [18.10.1998]

     * New species: Draconian (yes, I have been playing too much
       Zangband!);
     * New classes: Healer, Chaos Knight, Transmuter;
     * New monsters, including some which make curse skulls look
       completely harmless;
     * Religions and altars -- there are 8 or 9 gods who you can worship,
       each of whom requires different forms of devotion and offer
       different advantages;
     * Greatly expanded Transmigration magic, including
       self-transformations;
     * Several new dungeon branches;
     * Necromantic weapons (draining, vampiric, etc) are now more
       effective;
     * Significant balance changes -- deep levels should be harder now;
     * Special abilities ordered in the new 'a' abilities menu;
     * New items, spells, monsters, etc. as usual; and
     * A number of bugs found in the source by Daniel Ligon were erased.



2.72 [~02.10.1998]

     * Another bug fix version (there seem to be a lot of these); and
     * Still a couple more bugs from 2.71 to bash and the balance may
       have been a little on the easy side.



2.71 [25.09.1998]

     * Bug fix version.



2.70 [22.09.1998]

     Heaps of new features (I almost called this version 3.0):

     * New species to choose from: Ogre, Troll, Ogre Mage;
     * New class: Venom Mage;
     * Several huge branches (extra dungeons branching off from the main
       one), each containing special new monsters and terrifying vaults;
     * New winning conditions;
     * Player ghosts;
     * Mutations;
     * Many new items, spells, monsters;
     * Several bugfixes; and
     * ... a heap of other stuff.



2.61 [06.09.1998]

     A bug fix version:

     * Levitation is no longer permanent;
     * Fixes dropping-worn-armour bug;
     * Fixes item destruction bug (when picking up an item from the
       middle or bottom of an item pile);
     * Fixes poison and sticky flame bugs (neither worked properly);
     * Fixes 'program bug' bug;
     * The recall message screen no longer crashes the game;
     * Paralysis works again;
     * Drained dexterity is now displayed properly;
     * Some essential files were accidentally omitted from the source
       distribution -- they have been replaced;
     * Something I forgot to mention for 2.60: most rings no longer use
       food -- check them with 'V' when identified; and
     * There is a 'little surprise in this release which gives an
       indication of what will be in the next big release'.



2.60 [01.09.1998]

     The Source Code Clean-up is finally finished!

     * Functions have been split up into about 30 different modules,
       making coding *much* easier;
     * All functions are now available from any module;
     * An alternative display set for non-IBM graphics displays included
       (activate it with a -c command-line switch);
     * Several minor balancing changes were made; and
     * If the game crashes, you can continue from the last save (unless
       it crashed during saving). Your game is autosaved every time you
       climb stairs.

     A great number of interface changes were made, many of which were
     suggested by Eino Keskitalo and Jim Baranovich. These include:

     * The clumsy '^' untrap command has been replaced by a new use for
       the control key;
     * The character selection menus have been streamlined, with a new
       random option;
     * Shop displays are easier to read;
     * The old message display has been rendered readable;
     * It is now possible to reorder items and spells; and
     * Various other things.



2.51 [18.05.1998]

     Purely a bug fix version:

     * Item 1 no longer turns green on saving;
     * *Hopefully* the horrible item bug has been permanently removed (at
       least parts of it have, anyway);
     * Repeatedly casting Deflect Missiles no longer causes problems;
     * Skill selection now works properly (there were some problems in
       2.50); and
     * A couple of bugs in monster teleportation have been fixed.



2.50 [03.05.1998]

     Changes made:

     * Character classes made much more relevant;
     * Class system is back, in a slightly different form. Characters now
       gain a certain amount of skills when the gain levels (depending on
       which class they are). The old system is still in place but
       advancement is slower with it;
     * New class: Death Knights;
     * Monsters can now use more kinds of items;
     * Heaps of items, monsters, spells etc added;
     * Naga and Gnome character species added;
     * Rings of teleport control now available;
     * Levitating across water or lava works properly now;
     * Shields are now much more effective;
     * All known manifestations of the horrible item bug have been
       tracked down and fixed (except for the apparently harmless
       items-turning-green thing); and
     * Et cetera.



2.41 [~22.04.1998]

     Bugs fixed:

     * The game occasionally crashed in the iron city of Dis;
     * Gates out of pandemonium were too rare;
     * There were problems with saving and restoring magic points; and
     * The source code distribution was extremely confusing.



2.40 [~19.04.1998]

     * Two new races: Kobolds and Mummies;
     * Five new classes: Four types of elementalist and a fighter/wizard
       [Crusader] class;
     * New skills -- elemental magic and traps and doors;
     * New spells to go with the new skills and a spell failure system;
     * Heaps of spells, items, and monsters added (as usual);
     * You now get 1/2 experience for monsters killed by tame monsters;
       and
     * A large part of the monster and skills code was rewritten and
       generally cleaned up by $pellbinder (Wladimir van der Laan).



(2.33) 2.34 [~22.03.1998]

     * A crash bug and some problems with items should be fixed with this
       release; and
     * I forget right now, but these releases probably just fixed stuff.



2.32 [~15.03.1998]

     * Even more cool stuff fixed;
     * Level files are now deleted properly under Windows 95;
     * Removed a bug which sometimes caused the dungeon generator to
       hang; and
     * Compiling no longer generates warnings.



2.31 [~13.03.1998]

     * Lots of cool stuff fixed;
     * Fixes the problem with magic missiles and saves; and
     * Adds amulets and several new types of armour.



2.30 [~11.03.1998]

     * Lots of cool stuff added;
     * New in this version is a character race system with ten races to
       choose from and a trove of new monsters and items; and
     * Character dump feature implemented in the last version has been
       fixed now so you'll be able to swamp the newsgroups and annoy the
       regulars with ritualistic weekly reports of your favourite
       adventurer.



2.21 [~20.02.1998]

     * Various bugfixes and minor changes;
     * Added the ability to produce character dumps (popular with the
       newsgroup egocentrics); and
     * Among the usual bunch of fixes, characters now get the chance to
       disarm traps (especially thieves).



2.20 [~15.02.1998]

     * Added a comprehensive skills system;
     * Angband-style vaults and unique monsters;
     * Fixed a few very minor bugs and added a vast number of new
       features, the Abyss, Pandemonium, etc.; and
     * Dungeon architecture is also a lot more varied.



2.11 [~21.01.1998]

     * First Linux release, ported to Linux by Svante Gerhard;
     * Updated source tree allows for easier ports onto other Unix
       systems; and
     * The port will apparently also run on a Sun Sparc running SunOS.



2.10 [30.12.1997]

     Sorry to all of the many people who've been sending me bug reports,
     but it's become too tricky to list all bugs and credit their
     finder. I'm just getting too much email, and my mail reader has a
     strange way of eating some messages and making them very difficult
     to find. So from now on, I'll just list some of the major bugs
     fixed and major features added:

     * A bug with wearing armour of fire/cold resistance was fixed;
     * The properties of several items and spells were tweaked a bit;
     * Specialist wizards were made even more powerful in their
       discipline;
     * The dungeon was made deeper (36 levels now), and lots of new
       monsters were added to fill in the deeper levels;
     * Several spells (mostly necromancy) were added;
     * The dungeon architecture is a bit more varied, especially as you
       get deeper; and
     * A warning was added to labyrinths ... among other things.



2.03 [22.12.1997]

     This version fixes a few bugs, and puts back the floating point
     emulation which was missing from previous version 2 releases
     (Daniel Josef Dekok and someone else noticed this). It also removes
     the debugging code which was accidentally included. Bugs fixed:

     * Butterfly corpses were coloured black, making them invisible
       (Bridget Farace);
     * Shadow lanterns were also coloured black, and kept on working even
       after you unwielded them (Bridget Farace);
     * Items purchased from shops were not identified properly (Lord Gek,
       Timo Laitila);
     * Scrolls of Acquirement weren't being identified after being read;
     * When you got hit by a monster wielding a weapon of draining,
       events could become confusing (Timo Laitila);
     * Finally, the '5' key on the keypad works as a rest key (Timo
       Laitila); and
     * Names longer than 8 letters caused problems with saving and
       restoring games, especially in Windows 95 (Lord Gek and Timo
       Laitila).

     The following new features were also added:

     * When tame creatures kill monsters, you now get 1/3 xp (Howard
       Liu);
     * Orcish spellcasters have been downgraded a bit (lots of people
       recommended this);
     * Specialist wizards are now slightly more powerful in their
       specialisation, especially with magical staves (I can't find the
       usenet post which told me about this); and
     * ... A few other minor changes.



2.02 [13.12.1997]

     I'm afraid that 2.01 didn't fully fix the bug in the shop code, but
     hopefully this version does. Just about the only differences
     between this version and 2.01 are:

     * Pressing 'r', 's', or 't' while in a shop really no longer crashes
       the game (Saradon and Bridget Farace);
     * If the scores file is not present, a new one is generated. I've
       stopped including a scores file in the distribution, so that you
       can unpack the zip file into your old crawl directory and keep on
       using the old score file; and
     * Save games should be compatible with 2.01.



2.01 [12.12.1997]

     I had wanted version 2.0 to be a stable and bug-less release, but
     this was not to be. Anyway, 2.01 fixes these bugs:

     * Zapping a wand of polymorph at yourself caused problems (polymorph
       self hasn't been implemented anyway) (Saradon);
     * Polymorph other didn't work properly;
     * Choosing a non-existent item in a shop crashed the game (but only
       sometimes, which was why I didn't notice it) (Saradon);
     * Spell descriptions weren't working properly (Saradon);
     * Some messages were misspelt due to an indiscriminate
       search/replace (Adam Horowitz);
     * Detect curse didn't detect curses on unrecognised rings (this bug
       had been present right from version 1.0);
     * Sometimes, a special weapon in the hands of a monster would not
       function properly (watch out for creatures wielding weapons of
       draining!);
     * The use of the control key was not mentioned in the command list
       (it opens/closes doors, like in Angband); and
     * ... a few others (if I haven't credited someone, please tell me).

     Also, a few new things were added, as suggested by Saradon: A shout
     command ('!') to attract your followers (and enemies!), and better
     equipment for the enchanter. Also, you are now given a difficulty
     message and prompted when memorising spells, so you will know which
     spells you won't be able to cast reliably before you memorise them.

     * Scrolls of Acquirement create much better items; and
     * Enchanters now get a magical dagger/robe with which to start.



2.0 [09.12.1997]

     There have been so many additions in this version that I'm not
     going to list them all, but here is a very incomplete list of bugs
     and things rectified:

     * Characters could cause an excessive amount of damage empty-handed
       (Bridget Farace);
     * Darts didn't fire properly when character not wielding anything
       (Bridget Farace);
     * Hand crossbows didn't work properly;
     * Fireballs always did the same amount of damage (0-27), regardless
       of who cast them and how powerful they were;
     * Going to Hell could have unexpected results due to an
       out-of-bounds reference to levels_exist[];
     * Permanent levels, which are saved when you leave, and to which you
       can later return;
     * Shops;
     * Several new character classes, including Rangers, Assassins,
       Summoners, etc.;
     * A more interesting Hell;
     * New creatures, items, and spells;
     * Written descriptions of every single item, spell, and monster in
       the game; and
     * Several bugs squashed.



1.22 [~06.11.1997]

     * Fixes a minor bug with weapons of slay orc and brings back the old
       spell level system.



1.21 [~03.11.1997]

     * Fixes a bug which caused problems with high-level spellcasting.



1.2 [02.11.1997]

     * The monster and cloud location bits have been completely
       rewritten, a process which turned out to be rather easier than I
       thought it would be. The new system is much more flexible;
     * Monsters are now a bit more intelligent, especially in the way
       they treat clouds;
     * Several monsters have been added;
     * Several items and two new classes of items (Carrion and
       Miscellaneous) have been added;
     * Several spells, most of them necromantic, have been added;
     * The Gladiator, Necromancer, and Paladin classes have been added;
     * A spell type system has been implemented, and several new staves
       to specialise in particular types of magic have been added
       (conjuration, summoning etc.);
     * New unique items have been added, and a bug (actually, a mistype)
       which prevented some from being generated has been removed;
     * A few bugs have been removed; and
     * Several other changes have been made, too numerous to mention
       here.



1.10 [14.10.1997]

     * Several new items and monsters were added;
     * Labyrinths were added;
     * Magical weapons are now less powerful;
     * Some bugs have been fixed -- I forget what they were right now;
       and
     * The source was released, and Crawl is now under the GPL (see
       Licence.txt for details).



1.05 [07.10.1997]

     * A minor display bug was fixed;
     * A bug with restoring clouds from saved games was fixed;
     * A major bug which caused a segment violation when restoring saved
       games if there were any magical traps on the level was finally
       discovered and fixed;
     * Those pathetic worms you see around level 6 are now nastier, and
       jackals now tend to appear in packs; and
     * This time, your item memory really does work.



1.04 [06.10.1997]

     * A few really nasty bugs with saved games were fixed. The game
       would not save enchantments affecting monsters, and would mess up
       the items carried by the monsters (Adam Horowitz);
     * A bug with the enchanting/corroding of shields was fixed;
     * A '<=' instead of a '<' led to characters not using shields
       occasionally blocking trap missiles (Adam Horowitz);
     * You can now type '+' or '-' in the map screen to move around
       faster (Adam Horowitz);
     * The direction function now accepts '.' as well as delete (Adam
       Horowitz);
     * During your first step while long-walking, you can walk on
       anything (still prompts for water, etc., though) (Adam Horowitz);
       and
     * I think that was all.



1.03 [04.10.1997]

     * Some unique items were added;
     * A silly bug, by which your item knowledge was not saved, was fixed
       (Darren Hebden);
     * Teleport traps now work properly; and
     * I think I fixed another bug, but I can't remember.



1.02 [04.10.1997]

     * A few more items and traps have been added;
     * The game now uses the rogue keys (hjklyubn) properly; and
     * You used to be able to throw and zap straight when confused. No
       longer!



1.01 [03.10.1997]

     * Shields were changed;
     * Items were made more common;
     * Monsters were made less common (this was a bug);
     * Cursed weapons were made less common (this was just bad planning);
       and
     * I changed the name to make it a bit less egotistical.

     Bugs removed include:

     * A debugging feature of the 'x' command was unintentionally left
       in;
     * The summon scorpions spell summoned a vampire (oops) (Haran
       Pilpel);
     * Sometimes +50 armour could be generated (oops again) (Haran
       Pilpel);
     * The inventory item counter was not decremented when you dropped
       something! This would lead to you being unable to pick things up
       after a while (Darren Hebden);
     * A bug with detect curse scrolls (Darren Hebden);
     * Slime creatures and jellies were a bit weak;
     * Killing normal (not spitting) plants gave you far too much xp;
     * Your rate of regeneration was not saved properly;
     * About half of the rings could never be generated;
     * The 's' command would sometimes make you repeat your last move
       (Haran Pilpel);
     * I forgot to mention the walk-in-place function in any
       documentation;
     * I set the level builder to put 100 monsters on each new level for
       debugging, and forgot to reset it -- I really should playtest
       more!;
     * If you tried to cast spell 'z', you cast the identify spell (Lucas
       Ackerman); and
     * A few more fixes which I forget right now.



Linley's First: 1.00 [02.10.1997]

     * First (rather buggy) version.
