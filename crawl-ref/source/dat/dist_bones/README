This folder contains precompiled bones permastore files that are drawn upon if
there are no regular bones files for a level. This comes up for two cases: when
playing offline, and when playing online for certain servers that don't preserve
bones files across trunk version updates.

To compile a new set of bones files:
1. Collect bones folders from some set of servers.
2. Use the --bones commands to the crawl binary to:
   a. Merge permastores from different servers together.
   b. Merge regular bones files into permastores as needed.
   c. Filter out some of the more common combos (e.g. mibe).
   d. Filter out inappropriate names, for bones files where names are not
      randomized.
   e. Filter out repeated names, at least to some degree.
