# This file contains the messages used to "announce" a spell, like
# "The wizard mumbles some strange words."  The messages are looked
# up in the following order by the following keys:
#
# 1) The name of the spell being cast:
#   a) First try with the type, then the species, the the genus.
#   b) If a wizard, "wizard"; similarly for priest, demon, and innate.
#   c) If being cast by a wizard or priest monster with arms, first try
#      with the suffix "real".
#   d) If being cast by a monster of normal or higher intelligence with arms,
#      try with the suffix "gestures".
#   e) Next, try without any suffix.
# 2) The name of the monster's type, then species, then genus.
# 3) "priest" if the spell is an invocation, "wizard" if it's a wizard spell,
#    or "demon" if it's demonic.
# 4) If the spell uses a targeted, visible beam:
#   a) "<beam_short_name> beam".
#   b) "beam catchall".
#
# For 2 and 3, if the spell has a target it will first add the suffix
# "targeted" to the lookup key before trying without the suffix.
#
# For any of them, if a wizard has no arms, it will use "non-humanoid wizard"
# instead of "wizard."
#
# For example, a greater naga casting Teleport Self:
# * Teleport Self greater naga cast
# * Teleport Self naga cast
# * Teleport Self naga cast
# * Teleport Self wizard cast
# * Teleport Self cast real
# * Teleport Self cast gestures
# * Teleport Self cast
# * greater naga cast
# * naga cast
# * naga cast
# * wizard cast
#
# And one "casting" Spit Poison:
# * Spit Poison greater naga cast
# * Spit Poison naga cast
# * Spit Poison naga cast
# * Spit Poison naga cast
# * Spit Poison innate cast
# * Spit Poison cast gestures
# * Spit Poison cast
# * greater naga cast targeted
# * greater naga cast
# * naga cast targeted
# * naga cast
# * naga cast targeted
# * naga cast
# * poison beam cast
# * catchall beam cast
#
# For all lookups, if the monster is unseen by the player it will add the
# prefix "unseen" to the key, or if the player or monster is silenced
# it will prefix "silent" to the key (if the monster is both unseen and
# unheard no message is ever given). If using the prefix "silent" gives
# no results it will try again without the prefix, assuming that the
# spell has no sound component.
#
# To give no message use the string "__NONE".
