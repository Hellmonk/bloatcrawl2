Guide to des files
==================

des files are mostly used for creating parts of maps. Typical examples are
arrival vaults or most branch ends. They are organised into several
subdirectories of dat/des, namely

branches  = maps special to a branch, and branch ends
portals   = maps needed for portal vaults like gauntlets or bazaars
arrival   = Dungeon arrival vaults
variable  = floating vaults, minivaults
altar     = overflow and other altars
serial    = for serial vaults (a chain of small vaults to be used on one level)
traps     = lua defined trap vaults
builder   = layouts and other vaults placed specially during level-building
            (shops, uniques, etc.)
sprint    = maps for the Dungeon Sprint minigame
tutorial  = maps for the tutorial minigame
test      = vaults used for testing the game
