# A shop (or perhaps really a series of shops) that sells items whose names all
# start with the same letter. For alphabetizing purposes, any initial class
# description such as "amulet/book/manual/pair/potion/ring/rod/scroll/staff/
# wand of (the)" was ignored so the shops would have more variety between them.
# Various items, such as carrion, hides, blessed weapons, and nonphysical decks,
# aren't listed. Letters with less than five items don't get shops. Code exists
# for shopless letters anyway, so there's less code editing needed if they get
# new items at some point in the future.
