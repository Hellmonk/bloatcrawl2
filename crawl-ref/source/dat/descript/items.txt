scroll of silence

A scroll that eliminates all sound near the reader. This makes reading scrolls,
casting spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the
reader's vicinity. The scroll's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly
hamper stealth.

Certain monsters have innate magical or special abilities which will still be
usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a large radius, which will then shrink, eventually
covering only the reader, before it times out.
