The last and greatest work of the Warper Golubria, detailing the most powerful

and understand, as copies of the book and their contents have a tendency to
shift between planes at a moment's notice.
%%%%

to the translocational energy field, initially disorienting the wearer for a
few turns.
%%%%

This is a talisman crafted to call the attention of the gods to its wearer.

be divided between the wearer's reserves of health and magic.

function, it must first attune itself to the wearer's body at full health.

digestion are cumulative over time and are initially small.

and worn as a primitive garment. It offers rudimentary protection against harm,
but, having never been tanned, it carries a light stench of rotting flesh.

text is revealed as the ink condenses from the air onto the pages.
%%%%
book of annihilations

Blood leaks from the tattered pages of this book, and even an illiterate will
feel the sheer impact of arcane fury contained within. It is sought after by
sorcerers, for it allows the gifted and resourceful to command destruction with

this opus.

happen anymore.

art depicting scenes of disgusting decay and horrifying death.
%%%%
book of debilitation

A book containing Hexes useful for an Arcane Marksman. Many of the pages inside
are filled with holes, as if they had been used as archery targets before being
inscribed and bound. This occult technique supposedly gives the spells an
affinity for being used with ranged weapons, though, in practice, they appear
to work no differently from the variants found in less-perforated texts.
%%%%
book of dreams

A record of the somniloquent utterings of an entranced mystic, describing a
number of spells reflecting the mystic's dream state. Critics of the work argue
that the spells are functionally no different from ones already known, but the
book remains popular for its uniquely bizarre imagery and cryptic digressions.
%%%%

sparkles and shimmers as the pages are flipped. The quaintly anachronistic
title reflects an earlier, more incomplete arcane understanding of these two
schools of magic.

%%%%
book of maledictions

This spellbook teaches Enchanters how to weaken and confound their enemies with
Hexes before finishing them off. The frontispiece contains a depiction of an
evil eye, an ancient cursed symbol; this has occasioned numerous tales of
adventurers who met bad ends after carrying this book into the dungeon. Though,
as sceptics point out, pretty much everybody who enters the dungeon meets a bad
end.
%%%%
book of minor magic

A spellbook containing a variety of simple but useful magical incantations.
Many prominent spellcasters used this book to begin their arcane studies.
%%%%
book of necromancy

party, as well as a number of toasts, jokes, and party games.

energies.

still be found in magical libraries all across the world, although sometimes
not on the same shelf where the librarian left it.

A magical device which can be used to restore magical energy, with its
