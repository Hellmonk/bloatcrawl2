%%%%
Full status

You have eaten a lot.
%%%%
Very Full status

You have eaten almost all you can for now.
%%%%
Engorged status

You can't eat any more for now.
%%%%
Fast status

All of your actions are 50% faster. This causes magical contamination
over time, and may cause dangerous levels of contamination if you were
already contaminated before gaining this status.
%%%%
Invis status

You are invisible. Most enemies will be unable to see you and will
suffer penalties to hit, though they may be able to guess at your
general location. Invis causes magical contamination over time, and
may cause dangerous levels of contamination if you were already
contaminated before gaining this status. If this effect is greyed out,
it is active (and causing contamination) but ineffective for some
reason (e.g. you are glowing, lit an angel's halo, etc).
%%%%
Tele status

You are about to teleport, i.e. feeling "unstable". If you are about to
teleport, another effect that applies Tele (a scroll, wand, etc) will
cancel it.
%%%%
Fly status

You fly above the ground, and are able to cross water and lava or fight
above shallow water without penalties. Most types of flight will time out
- be sure you're not above deadly liquids when that happens!
%%%%
Agi status

You are unnaturally agile. This provides bonuses to your dexterity, evasion,
and stealth.
%%%%
Brill status

You are unnaturally smart. This provides bonuses to your intelligence,
spellcasting success, and spellpower.
%%%%
Might status

You are unnaturally strong. This provides bonuses to your strength and damage
in physical combat.
%%%%
Regen status

You regenerate hit points at an unnaturally fast rate. This is only shown for
temporary regeneration.
%%%%
RMsl status

You repel missiles, i.e. there's a good chance to evade them. This effect, if
provided by a spell, has a chance to expire with every projectile it repels;
it otherwise lasts indefinitely.
%%%%
DMsl status

You deflect missiles, i.e. there's a great chance to evade them. This effect,
if provided by a spell, has a chance to expire with every projectile it
deflects; it otherwise lasts indefinitely.
%%%%
Touch status

Your unarmed attacks no longer deal damage, but have a chance of confusing
monsters that they hit.
%%%%
MR status

You are more resistant to hostile enchantments.
%%%%
Berserk status

You are stronger, faster, tougher! Beware, though, that if you do not kill
monsters this status will wear off even faster, and when it does, you will
be slowed and exhausted, possibly passing out temporarily as well.
%%%%
Hungry status

Most species can eat chunks of corpses only if hungry.
%%%%
Very Hungry status

You are even hungrier than usual.
%%%%
Near Starving status

You are in desperate need of food.
%%%%
Starving status

You should really eat something; death is not far away. While starving, your
combat abilities are impaired and you are unable to cast spells or use many
evoked or divine abilities.
%%%%
Fainting status

You are beyond starving, and are likely to lose consciousness and die at any
moment.
%%%%
Pois status

You are poisoned and continually lose hit points. While poisoned, your current
health will be partially recoloured to display the eventual poison damage that
will be dealt. Cure with potions of curing or by waiting it out.
%%%%
Conf status

You are confused. Actions may not work properly, or may be targeted in a
random direction. Spellcasting and scroll use are completely impossible.
Wait it out, or drink a potion of curing for immediate relief.
%%%%
Contam status

You glow with mutagenic radiation. This can mutate you over time, usually with
a bad outcome. The colour indicates the severity: the first level (darkgrey)
is only a warning, and no mutation or loss of stealth will occur from it.
%%%%
Drain status

Your skills have been drained by negative energy, and are less effective.
This status will not wear off by waiting, but will expire as you gain
experience. This status has multiple levels, and you can see just how much you
have been drained by looking at the skills screen.
%%%%
Breath status

Some abilities (like breath weapons or Zin's recite invocation) require you to
catch your breath in between uses. These abilities cannot be re-used until the
Breath status disappears.
%%%%
Exh status

You are too exhausted to use certain tiring abilities; notably, Berserk.
%%%%
Slow status

All your actions take 50% longer.
%%%%
Para status

You are paralysed, and completely unable to act.
%%%%
Sleep status

You are asleep, and completely unable to act. Attacks will wake you.
%%%%
Held status

You are held in a net or a spider web. You cannot move freely and will instead
try to struggle free.
%%%%
Constr status

You are being constricted by an enemy and will take an increasing amount of
damage every turn. Also, movement (including blinking) away from the enemy is
restricted, although you can struggle to escape and will become increasingly
more likely to succeed when doing so multiple times.
%%%%
Mesm status

You are mesmerised and cannot move away from the monster(s) mesmerising you.
The effect can be broken by killing or confusing the responsible monster(s),
breaking line of sight with them, or by hearing an extremely loud noise,
such as those created by lightning or scrolls of noise.
%%%%
Fear status

You are overcome with fear and cannot move towards the monster(s) causing
fear in you. The effect can be broken by killing or confusing the responsible
monster(s), breaking line of sight with them, or by hearing an extremely loud
noise, such as those created by lightning or scrolls of noise.
%%%%
-Tele status

Some effect is preventing you from teleporting or blinking.
%%%%
Mark status

Due to the effects of a trap or a spell, monsters will now hunt you down more
precisely, and will be able to detect you even if you are not in their vision.
%%%%
Fire status

You are covered with sticky fire, which causes damage over the next few turns.
Entering water will extinguish the flames.
%%%%
Corona status

You are surrounded by light; this ruins your stealth and makes you easier to
hit.
%%%%
Barbs status

There are dangerous barbs embedded in your skin, and moving around will cause
you to take damage. They will go away after standing in place for a few turns
or moving around.
%%%%
Sick status

You have been sickened by some hostile effect. Hit points don't regenerate
until cured (wait it out or quaff a potion of curing). Occasionally a primary
attribute might drop.
%%%%
Vertigo status

Translocational magic is disorienting you and making you dizzy. It should
pass soon, but until then you will have difficulty attacking, dodging, and
casting spells.
%%%%
Corr status

Your equipment is covered with noxious acid! Both your effectiveness in
physical combat and defenses (AC) are reduced; the displayed number indicates
the former. After some time passes, the effect will disappear.
%%%%
Flay status

You are covered in illusionary - but nonetheless deadly! - wounds. Destroying
the source of the illusion will restore the health that was 'flayed' away.
%%%%
Weak status

Your physical attacks do less damage.
%%%%
Roots status

You are held to the ground by animated roots. Your movement speed is slower,
your evasion is reduced, and you are unable to fly.
%%%%
Frozen status

You are covered in ice, and your movement speed is reduced.
%%%%
Sap status

Some demonic force is inhibiting your spellcasting; every spell that you cast
while this status is in effect will reduce your chances of casting more spells
successfuly. Casting stronger spells will reduce your success chances more than
casting weak spells will.
%%%%
Brainless status

Your Intelligence attribute has fallen to 0. You are slowed, cannot cast spells,
and are very unlikely to be able to read even a scroll - spellbooks are entirely
beyond you. Increasing your Intelligence above 0 will cause the status to go away
in a few turns.
%%%%
Clumsy status

Your Dexterity attribute has fallen to 0. You are slowed, cannot sneak or use
shields, and are almost entirely unable to dodge. Increasing your Dexterity
above 0 will cause the status to go away in a few turns.
%%%%
Collapse status

Your Strength attribute has fallen to 0. You are slowed, and your regeneration
is crippled. Increasing your Strength above 0 will cause the status to go away
in a few turns.
