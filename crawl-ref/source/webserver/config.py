# Warning! Servers will not update or merge with the version controlled copy of
# this file, so any parameters here, and code that uses them, need to come
# without the assumption that they will be present in any given config.py on a
# server. Furthermore, on a typical rebuild in a production server, a running
# webtiles server *will not restart*, so you can't even assume that any config-
# specific code that you've added will be consistently present. This
# particularly impacts templated html files, which are loaded and called
# dynamically, so *do* get updated immediately on a rebuild. If something like
# client.html raises an exception, this will trigger 500 errors across the whole
# server.
#
# One useful workaround for all this is to get config paramters with the builtin
# `getattr` function: e.g. `getattr(config, "dgl_mode", False) will safely get
# this variable from the module, defaulting to False if it doesn't exist (and
# not raising an exception). `hasattr` is also safe.
