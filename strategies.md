Here are some basic starting strategies for those who are new to this fork. Things are so different here than "vanilla" crawl, that these strategies can be 
quite helpful for showing the possibilities, as well as helping those who are struggling to survive in this fork.

## General strategies

### Melee Fighters
    Heavier weapons will consume more stamina, and when you are out of stamina, you will be slower and do less damage. To
    reduce stamina costs for attacks, you will need to train fighting and increase your strength. This means that sometimes
    you will be better off using a lighter weapon (a mace instead of a great mace, for example) until you can get your stamina
    costs low enough to effectively wield the heavier ones. You can often do more damage with a lighter weapon in power mode
    than you could with a heavier weapon that forces you to frequently fight in an exhausted state.
    
    If there is a chance you will need to run away from an encounter, don't use up too much stamina before deciding to do so.
    Switching to quick mode [g] is necessary to escape most situations, and quick mode consumes stamina for each movement.
    Once stamina is gone, you can't use quick mode, and will have a more difficult time escaping. 
    
    Also keep in mind that heavy armour and shields will increase how much stamina is used while moving in quick mode, so
    earlier in the game it may increase your survivability to wear lighter armour. 
    
### Ranged Fighters
    Bows consume less stamina to fire than crossbows, but do less damage. So if you are a species that has higher fighting
    aptitudes and/or greater strength, crossbows may be a better choice. If you are a species with particularly low strength,
    you'd be better off with slings or bows.
    
    Since ammo is unlimited, quiver "nothing" most of the time [q-]. Save your limited branded ammo for special enounters
    where they will do the most good. 
    
    Accuracy of ranged attacks drops significantly with distance. So getting your accuracy up is critical for a serious
    ranged attacker that prefers to take out foes before they can get close. Increase your dexterity and weapon skills
    to increase your accuracy. 
    
    Pay close attention to the stamina cost of different weapons. You can see it in the item description page where it 
    says "SP Cost". For example, a long bow has a considerbly higher SP cost than a shortbow, and even when you have 
    a longbow, it can be more effective to use the shortbow until you can get that SP cost down to reasonable levels. 
    Stamina costs are reduced by increasing strength and fighting skill.
     
    For ranged fighters with weak defenses and trouble with ranged accuracy (which applies to most starting hunters), 
    playing a lot of the game in "focus" mode [E] can be very helpful, since focus mode significantly increases
    accuracy and all defenses (EV, SH, AC, MR). However, this comes at the cost of doubling your stamina costs, so if
    you are struggling to not be exhausted for every battle, this may not be an option.
    
### General Spellcasters
    One major difference here is that you can continue to cast spells even when out of magic, and even when exhausted.
    However, your spell power will be diminished and your failure rates higher, so you want to avoid that situation as
    much as possible. 
    
    If you are often running low on MP, you can reduce your MP costs by increasing intelligence or 
    spellcasting skill. In the meantime, use lower cost spells. Since spell caps have been effectively removed, even
    level 1 spells can be viable and useful late in the game, at higher power levels. They are especially valuable early
    game, when their MP cost is usually quite low compared to higher level spells, and so can be cast with power mode on
    [e] (increasing spell power and spellcasting speed) for longer without exhausting you.

### Summoners and Necromancers
    Summoning and raising dead reduces your max mp, which limits the total summons that you can have, based on the MP
    costs of those spells. In other words, if you want to maintain more summons at once, reduce the costs of those spells.
    Most significantly, don't cast those spells while in focus or power mode if you can do without, since that will cut
    the cost in half.
    
    If you have a horde of undead skeletons, and you want to raise another skeleton of a more powerful corpse, but don't
    want to unsummon all of them, you can use [x] to select the one skeleton you want to release/unsummon, and press [q],
    which will unsummon that one creature, allowing you to raise the skeleton of the new monster. 
    
    You can do the same with normal summons. If you want to replace one of your summons with a different one, press [x],
    select that summon, then press [q] and it will disappear, freeing the magic that was used to summon it. 
    
## Troubleshooting

### Always running out of stamina (SP) when attacking
* Use a lighter weapon (which means lower SP cost). You can view SP cost in the item description page.
* Don't use exertion modes (power or focus modes) as much, since they double your SP cost.
    * Use [c] to cancel current exertion mode and switch back to normal mode.
* Reduce SP costs of your current weapon by training fighting or gaining strength.
* Don't leave quick mode on when battling. You can turn quick mode off with [s]. Quick mode burns stamina with every
  step you take, but not while you are standing still.
* Increase the size of your stamina pool with an artifact.
* Increase your SP regeneration rate with an amulet of stamina regeneration.

### Not having enough speed to escape, because SP keeps running out
* Conserve your SP better in a battle by using magic more, or exertion modes less (focus and power mode).
* Make sure you are in quick mode [g]. In non-quick mode (slow mode) you can't move faster than 1.1 even if you have
  a faster species or boots of running. In quick mode you will move faster than most monsters (unless you are a Naga).

### Always running out of magic (MP) when casting spells
* Use lower cost spells. You can see the spell costs in the spell detail page [S].
* Don't use exertion modes (power or focus modes) as much, since they double your MP cost.
* Reduce MP costs by training spellcasting or gaining intelligence. 
* Increase the size of your MP pool with an artifact.
* Increase your MP regeneration rate with an amulet of magic regeneration.

### Having trouble getting spell failure rates low enough to cast reliably
* Increase intelligence or spell school skills to reduce failure rate.
* Turn on focus mode, which significantly lowers failure rate.

### Can't get up the stairs to escape
* Turn focus mode on when you reach the stairs, before attempting to ascend, to increase your defenses. If the monsters 
  can't do damage to you, they can't interrupt you from ascending the stairs. 
* Get to the stairs a little faster. Make sure you have quick mode on and have saved enough stamina to pay for it. Use
  slow hexes to slow down the enemies or a haste potion to give you that extra few steps needed to escape. 
* Keep trying if you have plenty of health. You only need to make it past 1 turn without being damaged by a monster to 
  ascend the stairs.
* If your health is getting low, stop trying to ascend the stairs. Instead use a teleport scroll to get away.

### Can't stay in transmuted form for long
* Transmutations test again spell failure each time you attack while in that form. 
* Reduce spell failure rates, especially while in that form, as much as possible, to extend the duration of the form.
* You can reduce failure rate by increasing spell school skill (the skills that apply to that spell) as well as increasing
  dexterity.
