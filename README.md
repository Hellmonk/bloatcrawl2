# Bloatcrawl 2

Bloatcrawl 2 is a fork of [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://crawl.develz.org/) ([github](https://github.com/crawl/crawl)). If you aren't familiar with the base game this fork probably won't make any sense.

## New Species

=======
* **Argons** are, unlike most other living beings, made of gas. Some think they originated on a far away star.
* Strange beings from beyond the stars, **Astrals** cannot gain resistances to magic or the elements. Their attacks inflict powerful debuffs on beings from this world.
* **Dab Dwarves** have perfected the ancient art of dabbing. They can dab on multiple creatures at once and may even daze their foes with the power of their dab.
* **Faerie Dragons** are attuned to magic and their spells cost fewer magic points. Their shimmering scales repel attacks and their wings let them fly.
* **Flans** are gelatinous and slightly corrosive beings. Their fluid shape lets them fit easily into any body armour, but they cannot wear other armour types.
* Rolling around at the speed of sound, **Hedgehogs** have got places to go and gotta follow their rainbow.
* Irits are magical, brutish one-eyed humanoids. They are adept at casting spells in heavy armour, although it costs them life force to do so.
* **Kitsune** are enthralling fox spirits that take on human shapes. They are poor at most skills and frailer than humans, but can charm their foes.
* **Leprechauns** are small and frail but versatile. Their intrinsic luck gives them a knack for finding better items.
* Half insect, half human, **Mayflytaurs** have incredibly short lifespans but have evolved to be exceptionally overpowered in just about every imaginable way.
* Strange phantoms summoned from the mirror world, **Mirror Eidola** rapidly fade away. They must slay other creatures and take their energy to stay in this plane.
* **Oni** are monstrous in nature with the rough appearance of Ogres, albeit smaller. They discover spells as they gain experience and ignore schools of magic.
* Deeper than a Deep Elf and twice as elven, **Profound Elves** are extremely frail magical experts.
* **Proteans** are a race of vaguely humanoid amoebas. They grow in health and size as they mutate.
* **Quill orcs** love to read and hate close combat. They read books and scrolls at an uncanny pace.
* **Shapeshifters** imitate monsters around them to an uncanny degree. They cannot control their shifting, and are only rarely seen in their true form.
* **Slitherier Nagas** are offbrand Nagas, and about twice as much everything. Extremely healthy, extremely stealthy, extremely big, and excruciatingly slow.
* Less dextrous than other elves, **Squat Elves** have mastered the art of the power squat. They use this ability to enhance their strength and intelligence.
* **Troll Two**: They're eating her! And then they're going to eat me! Oh my GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHD!

## New Backgrounds

* No Kings, No Rulers (maybe a god though). **Anarchists** are bent on dismantling the dungeon hierarchy with rocks and explosives.
* Servants of the demon god Makhleb, **Blood Knights** begin with moderate skill in  combat and quickly learn to harness Makhleb's destructive power.
* **Bound** serve Ashenzari, the god of curses, and begin their journey partially bound with cursed equipment.
* **Cavepeople** start with exceptional strength but, unfortunately, neolithic weapons.
* **Dancers** have left their friends behind and entered the dungeon in service of Uskayaw. They have few combat skills but are quite good at evading attacks.
* Pontiffs of Yredelemnul, **Death Bishops** carry a weapon of draining and use the pain spell in service of their evil god.
* **Deprived** start with nothing but a ration and almost no skills. Survival may prove... difficult.
* **Disciples** follow the Wu Jian Council and begin the game with a good weapon.
* **Doctor**: Medical professionals from the surface occasionally enter the dungeon. They follow the healer god Elyvilon.
* **Entomologists** study insects and related creatures. They bring along a net and a sack of spiders, and can also summon butterflies.
* Incredibly dextrous, **Fencers** enter the dungeon with a rapier, gloves of dexterity, and an amulet of the acrobat.
* **Gambler**: Followers of Nemelex Xobeh who have lost everything in a run of bad luck sometimes venture into the Dungeon. They'll need Nemelex's help to turn things around.
* **Gardeners** worship Fedhas Madash and enter the dungeon to grow shrooms.
* Followers of Ru, **Hermits** renounce the world and follow the path of asceticism.
* **Inheritors** worship Hepliaklqana. The spirit of their ancestor follows them to the dungeon, and given their lack of skills they may need to rely on it.
* **Kikumancers** are like Necromancers, but they worship the god of necromancy instead of starting with a book of spells.
* **Librarians** come to the Dungeon in search of new books for their collection. They serve Sif Muna the Loreminder and bring a random book along with them.
* **Merchants** are followers of Gozag. Whether newly established or unsuccessful on the  surface world, they enter the Dungeon desperate for a source of income.
* **Meteorologists** predict the weather and carry around some handy evocable items to make their predictions come true.
* **Neckbeards** come to the Dungeon from their moms' basements with a cape, a fedora, 
a rusty katana and the ability to teleport behind you (nothing personal, kid).
* **Night Knights** follow the shadowy god Dithmenos. They begin lightly armoured but with good stealth.
* **Paladin**: Worshippers of The Shining One, these holy warriors fall down a lot.
* **Philosophers** bring their thinking hat to the dungeon, but not much else in the way of useful items.
* **Slime Priests** follow Jiyva, the slime god. They enter the dungeon already mutated by their deity's power but with only a small amount of divine favor.
* **Storm Clerics** spread destruction in the name of Qazlal.
* **Torpor Knights** follow Cheibriados and wear heavy, ponderous armour to gain their god's favour more quickly.
* **Uncles** search the dungeon for their lost nephews.
* It's opening night for "The Orb of Zot" and the hero is sick! The **Understudy** must learn their role quickly if they want to make it through the final act.
* **Warriors** are followers of Okawaru who bring a variety of equipment to the dungeon.
* Have you heard the good news of Beogh? **Witnesses** have.
* **Zinjas** worship Zin and very stealthily recite the Aixoms of Law.

## Other New Stuff

* **Dab** at any time with the `p` key.
* **Game Modifiers**: Select game modifiers when starting a new game. Play any species as a mummy. Remove rune locks. Etcetera.
* Unleash the elemental power of sound with the **Air Horn** evocable.
