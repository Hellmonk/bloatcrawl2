Bloatcrawl 2 is a fork of [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://crawl.develz.org/) ([github](https://github.com/crawl/crawl)). If you aren't familiar with the base game this fork probably won't make any sense.

## New Species

* ![Argon tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/argon_m.png) **Argons** are, unlike most other living beings, made of gas. They can only gain resistances by levelling up.
* Strange beings from beyond the stars, **Astrals** cannot gain resistances to magic or the elements. Their attacks inflict powerful debuffs on beings from this world.
* ![Bunyip tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/bunyip_m.png) **Bunyips** are strange, black, oily creatures that live in billabongs. They swim well but cannot call on divine powers or wear armour.
* **Dab Dwarves** have perfected the ancient art of dabbing. They can dab on multiple creatures at once and may even daze their foes with the power of their dab.
* **Ember Elves** have depleted magical reserves, but regenerate magical power quickly. As they develop, their magic becomes more powerful but harder to control.
* ![Faerie Dragon tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/faerie_dragon.png) **Faerie Dragons** are attuned to magic and their spells cost fewer magic points. Their shimmering scales repel attacks and their wings let them fly.
* **Flans** are gelatinous and slightly corrosive beings. Their fluid shape lets them fit easily into any body armour, but they cannot wear other armour types.
* ![Fungoid tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/fungoid.png) **Fungoids** are mushroomy humanoids with roots instead of feet. They cannot move when monsters are around, but release confusing spores at enemies when they attack.
* **Gnomes** are small creatures who are highly attuned with the earth. They are skilled in the use of magical devices and ranged weaponry.
* ![Hedgehog tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/hedgehog.png) Rolling around at the speed of sound, **Hedgehogs** have got places to go and gotta follow their rainbow.
* ![Hermit Crab tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/hermit_crab.png) **Hermit Crabs**: These clever crustaceans move into larger shells over time. If their shell is broken in an attack, they can usually escape and find a smaller replacement.
* **Irits** are magical, brutish one-eyed humanoids. They are adept at casting spells in heavy armour, although it costs them life force to do so.
* **Kitsune** are enthralling fox spirits that take on human shapes. They are poor at most skills and frailer than humans, but can charm their foes.
* ![Leprechaun tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/leprechaun_m.png) **Leprechauns** are small and frail but versatile. Their intrinsic luck gives them a knack for finding better items.
* ![Mayflytaur tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/mayflytaur.png) Half insect, half human, **Mayflytaurs** have incredibly short lifespans but have evolved to be exceptionally overpowered in just about every imaginable way.
* Strange phantoms summoned from the mirror world, **Mirror Eidola** rapidly fade away. They must slay other creatures and take their energy to stay in this plane.
* ![Oni tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/oni_m.png) **Oni** are monstrous in nature with the rough appearance of Ogres, albeit smaller. They discover spells as they gain experience and ignore schools of magic.
* Deeper than a Deep Elf and twice as elven, **Profound Elves** are extremely frail magical experts.
* ![Protean tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/protean_m.png) **Proteans** are a race of vaguely humanoid amoebas. They grow in health and size as they mutate.
* **Quill orcs** love to read and hate close combat. They read books and scrolls at an uncanny pace.
* **Ratlings** are verminous humanoids that mature at an incredible pace, but learn very slowly. They have an affinity for poison magic.
* ![Robot tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/robot.png) **Robots** are metallic humanoids crafted by Dwarves. They break equipment when uninstalling it and have a poor grasp of religion, but can shoot lasers.
* ![Shapeshifter tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/shapeshifter.png) **Shapeshifters** imitate monsters around them to an uncanny degree. They cannot control their shifting, and are only rarely seen in their true form.
* ![Silent Spectre tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/silent_spectre.png) **Silent Spectres** are terrible spirits that bring an unearthly silence to the area around them, preventing spell casting, divine invocations and even reading scrolls.
* ![Slitherier Naga tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/naga_m.png) **Slitherier Nagas** are offbrand Nagas, and about twice as much everything. Extremely healthy, extremely stealthy, extremely big, and excruciatingly slow.
* Less dextrous than other elves, **Squat Elves** have mastered the art of the power squat. They use this ability to enhance their strength and intelligence.
* ![Turtle tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/turtle.png) **Turtles** are hard-shelled warriors trained in the arts of ninjutsu. They fight evil wherever it can be found and follow a strict honour code.
* Deeper than deep, **Unfathomable Dwarves** cannot heal even through divine means. However, they have adapted to heal on kills and brew ambrosia potions from leftover life essence.
* ![Unipode tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/unipode.png) **Unipodes** are distantly related to Octopodes, but have a single tentacle instead of eight. They can only wear one ring and cannot use two-handed weapons.
* The permanently baked **Weed Elves** aren't quite as smart or nimble as other elves, but they are still skilled at magic. They trail smoke wherever they go.
* **Xeno Elves** are strange insectoid elves from a distant land. Their magical efficiency is far better than most species, but their magic drains when moving near enemies.
* ![Yeti tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/yeti_m.png) **Yeti** are large, seldom-seen creatures that live on frozen mountain peaks. Sufficiently mature Yeti passively freeze adjacent foes.
* ![Zodach tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/player/base/zodach.png) **Zodach** are the burnt-out remnants of a decayed celestial species. Nearby monsters are drawn in by their immense gravitas.

* ![Inheritor tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/gui/backgrounds/In.png) **Inheritors** worship Hepliaklqana. The spirit of their ancestor follows them to the dungeon, and given their lack of skills they may need to rely on it.
* ![Kikumancer tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/gui/backgrounds/Ki.png) **Kikumancers** are like Necromancers, but they worship the god of necromancy instead of starting with a book of spells.
* ![Librarian tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/gui/backgrounds/Li.png) **Librarians** come to the Dungeon in search of new books for their collection. They serve Sif Muna the Loreminder and bring a random book along with them.

* ![Misfortunate tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/gui/backgrounds/Mi.png) The **Misfortunate** received an unlucky robe from some shady source. Perhaps the robe attracted them to the dungeon for some reason?
* ![Neckbeard tile](crawl-ref/source/rltiles/gui/backgrounds/Nb.png) **Neckbeards** come to the Dungeon from their moms' basements with a cape, a fedora, a rusty katana and the ability to teleport behind you (nothing personal, kid).
