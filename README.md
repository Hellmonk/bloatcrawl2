# Bloatcrawl

This is a fork of [Dungeon Crawl Stone Stoup](https://github.com/crawl/crawl), adding a lot of new content, most of it terrible.

# New Species

**Golem** Formed from clay, Golems are robust constructs that cannot use equipment. They begin with incredible attributes that do not increase as they grow.

**Grue** Grues are strange, stealthy predators that are adapted to life in the darkness. They slip further into the shadows as they grow.

**Crystal Dwarf** Crystal Dwarves have reflective, crystalline skin that naturally shields them. Though less robust than other dwarves, they are skilled at elemental magic.

**Robot** Robots are metallic humanoids crafted by Dwarves. They break equipment when uninstalling it and have a poor grasp of religion, but can shoot lasers.

**Bodach** Bodach are mortal descendants of an ancient celestial species. They change between four distinct aspects, but have limited control over the process.

**Ember Elf** Ember Elves have depleted magical reserves, but regenerate magical power quickly. As they develop, their magic becomes more powerful but harder to control.

**Werewolf** Though the moon does not shine inside the dungeon, Werewolves' uncontrollable lycanthropy is sometimes triggered by their bloodlust.

**Obsidian Dwarf** An ancient species in which the fire of magic has cooled, Obsidian Dwarves must expend their lifeforce to cast spells. They both cause and receive extra harm.

**Angel** Angels are graceful, holy beings created by the Shining One. Most angels continue to serve their maker, but they are free to follow another god if they wish.

**Kitsune** Kitsune are enthralling fox spirits that take on human shapes. They are poor at most skills and frailer than humans, but can charm their foes.

**Flan** Flans are gelatinous and slightly corrosive beings. Their fluid shape lets them fit easily into any body armour, but they cannot wear other armour types.

**Yeti** Yeti are large, seldom-seen creatures that live on frozen mountain peaks. Sufficiently mature Yeti passively freeze their foes.

**Hedgehog** Rolling around at the speed of sound, Hedgehogs have got places to go and gotta follow their rainbow.

**Ratling** Ratlings are verminous humanoids that mature at an incredible pace, but learn very slowly. They have an affinity for poison magic.

**Leprechaun** Leprechauns are small and frail but versatile. Their intrinsic luck gives them a knack for finding better items and more gold than other species.

**Chaoskin** Created by Xom for reasons unknown, Chaoskin constantly evolve. They are better than average at everything, but can't escape Xom's attention for long.

**Profound Elf** Deeper than a Deep Elf and twice as elven, Profound Elves are extremely frail magical experts.

**Unipode** Unipodes are distantly related to Octopodes, but have a single tentacle instead of eight. They can only wear one ring and cannot use two-handed weapons.

**Fungoid** Fungoids are mushroom-like humanoids with roots instead of feet. They move exceptionally slowly but can release confusing spores at enemies when they attack.

**Water Sprite** Water Sprites are slow, extremely frail, and cannot read scrolls in the presence of monsters. However, they instantly heal themselves when alone.

**Felid Mummy** Felid Mummies are undead Felids whose lives have run out. It would take a true display of skill for one of these beings to snatch the Orb.

# New Backgrounds

**Noble** Nobles are wealthy elites who enter the Dungeon looking for adventure. They have poor attributes but bring the best equipment money can buy.

**Understudy** It's opening night for "The Orb of Zot" and the hero is sick! The Understudy must learn their role quickly if they want to make it through the final act.

**Deprived** Deprived start with nothing but a ration and almost no skills. Survival may prove... difficult.

**Slime Priest** Slime Priests follow the shapeless slime god Jiyva and are sent into the dungeon to spread slime and jellies.

**Annihilator** Annihilators follow the destructive magical god Vehumet. They know the Magic Dart spell and eventually learn new spells directly from their god.

**Blood Knight** Blood Knights follow the chaotic and destructive god Makhleb. They start with little skill in their chosen weapon but soon learn to invoke Makhleb's power.

**Torpor Knight** Torpor Knights follow Cheibriados and wear heavy, ponderous armour to gain their god's favour more quickly.

**Storm Cleric** Storm clerics spread destruction in the name of Qazlal.

**Accursed** Accursed serve Ashenzari, the god of curses, and come to the dungeon partially bound with cursed equipment.

**Gambler** Followers of Nemelex Xobeh who have lost everything in a run of bad luck sometimes venture into the Dungeon. They'll need Nemelex's help to turn things around.

**Merchant** Merchants are followers of Gozag. Whether newly established or unsuccessful on the surface world, they enter the Dungeon desperate for a source of income.

**Redneck** Rednecks bring their trusty wand of scattershot and a potion of degeneration to the Dungeon. They aren't good at much besides fighting.

**Alchemist** Alchemists carry a variety of helpful potions and a dagger but are inexperienced with combat.

**Entomologist** Entomologists study insects and related creatures. They bring along a net and a sack of spiders, and can also summon butterflies. 

**Farmer** Farmers carry a sharp, trusty scythe and have great attributes, but little else.

**Chef** Chefs know the basics of magically cooking and freezing monsters (though oddly they prefer butchered chunks raw). They are well supplied with food.

**Sorcerer** Sorcerers start with a random destructive spellbook and a (well-worn) robe of archmagi.

**Librarian** Librarians come to the Dungeon in search of new books for their collection. They bring a few random books along with them and know the Apportation spell.
